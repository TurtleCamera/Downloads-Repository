Additionally, you will implement the specular removal technique of [Mallick et al.](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~zickler/download/photodiff_cvpr05_preprint.pdf), which enables photometric stereo to be performed on certain non-Lambertian materials.\n",

For comparison, you should also integrate using the Horn technique which is already implemented for you in the `horn_integrate` function. Note that for good results you will often want to run the `horn_integrate` function with 10000-100000 iterations, which will take a while. For your final submission, we will require that you run Horn integration for 10000 (ten thousand) iterations or more in each case. But for debugging, it is suggested that you keep the number of iterations low.\n",
