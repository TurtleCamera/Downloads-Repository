                <h1 id="history" class="center">History</h1>
                <br>
                <img class="pImgRight" src="./images/timeline.png" />
                <p>The Company was founded in 1990 by a grocery store owner who invested $100 to open its first store. Over the past 140 years, the Company has steadfastly adhered to this philosophy, remaining specific about its customers and communities, its innovation, and the people it employs. Today, the Company is the nation's largest grocery retailer, with nearly 2,800 stores located in 35 states and operating under 28 brand names. We meet the evolving needs of our customers by delivering access to fresh food to all. Our current practices owe much to our founder's early dedication to serving customers through fresh food, competitive pricing, and innovation. The story is about the people who shaped our history and continue to shape our lives every day.</p>
                <p>Our founder was a born entrepreneur, always looking for new ways to satisfy his customers' needs. In the early 1900s, grocery stores used to buy random items from local residents and resell them at higher prices. In our founder’s opinion, this wasn’t a cool thing to do, and it was something he sold a lot of. He thought that if he could make his own products, he could lower his costs and give his customers better products instead of selling them again and again.</p>

                <p>You might ask, how can we possibly have 150 years of experience when we look so young?

That's right, we are simply that good, which further emphasizes why you should buy our products. </p>
