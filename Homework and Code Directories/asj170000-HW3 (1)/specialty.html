                <img class="pImgRight" src="./images/delicatessen.jpg" />
                <p>A delicatessen or deli is often a retail location that offers a variety of premium, unusual, or foreign prepared meals.</p>
                <p>In order to serve the growing population of German immigrants, the first delicatessens were opened in the United States in New York City in the early 1880s. The first kosher delicatessen was established in 1889, and as the German-Jewish community in New York City grew, so did the number of these establishments. By the late 20th to early 21st centuries, supermarkets, small-town shops, and fast-food restaurants started referring to certain areas of their establishments as "delis."</p>
                <p>The plural of the term "delikatesse," "delicatessen" is a German loanword that first emerged in English in the late 19th century. The Italian term delicato, whose base word is the Latin adjective delicatus and which means "giving pleasure, delightful, pleasing," was borrowed by the French to create the German word d√©licatesse. The French in turn was borrowed from the Italian word delicatezza. After World War II, according to the earliest available evidence from 1948, the first abbreviated form of this term to appear in English was "deli."</p>
