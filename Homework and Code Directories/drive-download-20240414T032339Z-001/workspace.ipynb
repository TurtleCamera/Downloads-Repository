During your life, on how many days have you had at least one drink of alcohol?\n","13. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have at least one drink of alcohol?\n","14. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have five or more drinks of alcohol in a row, that is, within a couple of hours?\n","15. During your life, how many times have you used marijuana?\n","16. During your life, how many times have you used any form of cocaine, including powder, crack, or freebase?\n","17.

out is that some columns have a considerably higher number of missing entries (at least 8000 entries missing), which are weapon, fight, 30_days_alcohol, consecutive_alcohol, sniffed, steroids, and milk. For those columns, missing entries tend to come from the surveys in the last 3 datasets (2015, 2017, and 2019). We do want to make a small note, however, that only the 30_days_alcohol column doesn't exhibit this pattern. The missing entries seem pretty uniformly distributed across all years.\n","\n","Double checking the questions in the manuals for all years, none of the questions and answers are worded differently except for the question asking about how many times did the student have 5 or more consecutive drinks of alcohol in the past 30 days. In the last 2 datasets (not 3, which we were suspecting), the question was worded to be \"4 or more\" for female students and \"5 or more\" for male students. We feel like this small change in wording shouldn't have caused such a big disparity in number of missing responses for consecutive_alcohol. It's even more strange that there is a difference in the other columns that didn't even have a change in question.\n","\n","We think it may still be safe to prune these students without much risk in altering our analysis much because the trends noted above are roughly the same for each column, but we'll still store  the columns with these missing entries just in case we still want to analyze it to see if the outcome of our models and plots do differ.
